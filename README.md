Heart Failure Prediction using Machine Learning
This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of a heart failure event using a clinical dataset. It leverages supervised machine learning techniques to analyze key health indicators and identify patterns associated with heart failure outcomes.

We used a Random Forest Classifier trained on features such as:

Age

Blood Pressure

Serum Creatinine

Ejection Fraction

Platelets

Serum Sodium

Diabetes and Anaemia status

Smoking history

Time duration (follow-up period)

The model achieved an accuracy of over 80%, making it a reliable tool for preliminary risk assessment. This project also includes a simple web interface built with Flask to demonstrate the model's prediction capability
